### Need to define well the inputs and outputs

Definition of benchmark functions
Generation of data based on parameters like search space limits, discrete intervals and so on
Monte Carlo sampling to emulate the behavior of sparse datas like real scenarios
Continuous definitions, like when we want to evaluate exact situations, get the exact gradient, and instead of summation use integrals or real derivatives
